This is a full CRUD app that allows a user to register and login through firebase.

The user can create a username and create/add, edit/update, and delete information about the exercises and nutrition pages.

The user can navigate through the app with the navbar which has associated links to each page through react-router-dom.

The goal of this app is to allow users to create their own login and username to become part of a community to increase personal health through fitness and nutrition. Allowing users to add their own information and the ability to see what others share to help improve their own knowledge base.
